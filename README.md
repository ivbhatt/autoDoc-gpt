<i>README generated by: `GPT-DocWriter` <br/> <br/> </i> 
The `autoDoc.py` script automates the process of generating a README file for a codebase stored in a GitHub repository. Here's an overview of what the script does:

1. Clones the GitHub repository specified in the input URL.
2. Checks out a new branch in the cloned repository.
3. Scans the codebase directory for code files (Python, C, C++, Jupyter Notebooks) and generates a GPT-3 prompt containing the content of these files.
4. Utilizes the OpenAI API to generate a README file based on the obtained GPT prompt.
5. Writes the generated README content to a file named `README.md` in the cloned repository.
6. Commits and pushes the generated README file to the specified GitHub repository under the new branch.
7. Outputs the URL to the newly generated README file for viewing.

To run the script, you need to provide the URL to the GitHub repository, your OpenAI API key, GitHub username, GitHub OAuth token with repo access, and the name of the new branch to be created for the README generation. This script allows for easy and automated README generation for codebases.
